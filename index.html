    <div class="health">
        <p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of
            intake
            and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee
            daily.
            Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk
            in
            pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor study quality,
            and
            differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.</p>

        <h2 class="types" align="center">Types</h2>
        <p class="ptypes">
            Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a
            genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to
            trees.
        </p><br><br>

    
        <li><strong>1. Type of bean.</strong> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica
            originates from
            Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However,
            it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade,
            humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more
            economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures
            between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in
            rainfall and strong sunlight.</li><br>
        <li><strong>2. Type of roast.</strong> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce
            a chemical
            change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with coffee. They are then cooled and
            ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, the
            lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with
            little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark.</li><br>
        <li><strong>3. Type of grind.</strong> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee
            makers. A fine grind
            is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee
            presses.</li><br>
        <li><strong>4. Decaffeinated coffee.</strong> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side
            effects from caffeine.
            The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical solvents (methylene
            chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are
            then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or
            dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the
            decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some
            loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor
            and scent may be destroyed during processing.</li>

           <div id="in2"><h2 align="center"> Starbucks</h2>
        <p>The brand is not known for sourcing and roasting the best coffee beans. Most of their coffee beans are dark roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. And many consumers, who know their coffee, complain that Starbucks coffee has a distinct burnt taste.</p></div>

           <div id="in2"><h2 align="center">Dunkin' Doughnuts</h2>
        <p>Dunkin' is not as big a brand as Starbucks but they are second in line in the number of stores. But yes, the coffee Dunkin' offers is surely somewhat superior to Starbucks. For instance, Dunkin' does not have the signature burnt taste in coffee as Starbucks does. The coffee is also cheaper.</p></div>
